# Wet Bulb Temperature Calculator

## Purpose
This project aims to provide a simple tool to calculate the **wet bulb temperature** based on air temperature and relative humidity. The wet bulb temperature is an important measure for assessing thermal comfort and the potential for heat stress in environments.

This script allows users to calculate the wet bulb temperature by simply providing the city name, with real-time weather data fetched from the OpenWeather API. It helps people monitor environmental conditions, especially in hot and humid climates.

## How to Use
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `app.py` file.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the script with:

`python app.py`

6. Enter the city name and check Wet Bulb Temperature in your terminal.

## Next steps

* Create a web-based tool: Use framework Flask to build a web interface for easier access to the wet bulb temperature calculation.
* Develop a mobile app: Create a mobile app for Android or iOS to make the wet bulb temperature calculator easily accessible on smartphones.
